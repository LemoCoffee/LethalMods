# Power of Christ

Howdy hi hello! This is a small joke mod made upon request from a friend.
Upon reaching low health, flashes of Jesus will fill the players screen as their time approaches, church bell ringing.

## Installation

Download with a mod manager, or throw the contents of the mod into your plugins folder

```
...\BepInEx\plugins\LemoCoffee-PowerOfChrist\LethalPowerOfChrist.dll
```
## Customization

Both the images and sound that the mod uses can be swapped out for each client. \ 
For replacing the sound, either replace the file titled `sound.wav` or add a new file in the mod's folder and change the name of the file name in the config. \ 
For the images, just throw any `.png` file into `\LemoCoffee-PowerOfChrist\images\` and next time you start up the game, those images should now be in the pool that the flashes can randomly draw from!

## Configuration
```
Volume - Changes the volume of the sound clip that plays accompanying each flash.
File Name - Name of the audio clip file, including extension. Supports ogg, mp3, and wav.
```
